# Graph Slam Backend

## Description

This is a graph slam backend written from scratch in C, mainly to help me gain
understanding of how it works. No libraries (other then stdlib) are used, and
the project currently contains a full working backend for a 2d (3 dof) system.

## TODO

 [ ] Write usage explaination and examples.
 [ ] Upload math for jacobians.
 [ ] Finish documentation.
